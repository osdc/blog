### History
[Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar) began working on *Vim* in 1988 for a company called [Amiga](https://www.amigaos.net/). He published first public release of Vim in 1991. 
The name *Vim* is an acronym for **VI improved** becauase *Vim* is an extended version of [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) editor. It was built with an aim of adding some additional features designed to help in source code editing. 

### Interface of Vim
Vim is based on text user interface and like other text editors it also has a GUI mode, [gVim](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/gui.html#GUI). Vim has a built-in tutorial for beginners(```vimtutor``` command). Vim also has a built in facility (```:help``` command) which allow user to serach,explore and query commands.

    vim +cmd or -c cmd <file-name>
```

#### Exiting Vim 
- In normal mode
    - ```:q!```             Quit Vim without saving the changes to the file.
    - ```ZQ```	            Same as :q! Quits Vim without writing changes
- Or 
    - ```Ctrl + z```    To send vim back in background
    - ``` $fg```        To get back in vim

#### Save
- ```:w```	            Save the file

### NeoVim
[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) also quoted as **Literally the future of Vim** is known for the cool and awesome features.
- Powerful
    The Nvim msgpack API enables structured communication to and from any programming language. Remote plugins run as co-processes that communicate with Neovim safely and asynchronously.
- Usable
    - Strong defaults
    - Works the same everywhere: one build-type, one command
    - Modern terminal features such as cursor styling, focus events, bracketed paste
    - Built-in terminal emulator
- Embeddable
    GUIs and other applications can nvim --embed to discover the msgpack API dynamically.
- Drop-in Vim
    Neovim is an extension of Vim: feature-parity and backwards-compatibility are high priorities. If you already use Vim, see :help nvim-from-vim.
