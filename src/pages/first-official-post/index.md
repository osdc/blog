Well, TBH we're not exactly sure what counts as an official post right now, but this is the first one regardless.
Let's talk about the current community activities:
 - Build-up, the hackathon - This will be held on 21st and 22nd of April in "cyber srishti". We still have to finalise the exact rules of the event, and design the logo. A hackathon has been the staple event of our community and we look forward to a great number of participants.
 - Web development workshop - Since we want more and more participants in the hackathon, we wanted to teach a little useful web developmet before it, so that people may learn new things before the event. We are currently teaching front-end design and ruby-on-rails.
 - Weekly blog - :)

We hope to start some more community projects, which will be small enough to be completed within a month (since this semester is about to end).
The next blog post will be after the hackathon. Let's hope we have a lot to talk about after it!
