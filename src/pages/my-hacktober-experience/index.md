## MY FIRST HACKTOBERFEST

I was not even a noob in the field of [open-source](https://osdcblog.netlify.com/Open-source-M1/)
before I was introduced with git and GitHub in 
the weekly meetup of our community.
It was a hands-on session for the basic commands
of git and we were given a brief description of
the open-source community.
By the end of the session, it was announced that next
week's agenda will be [**HACKTOBERFEST**](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). 
I was quite excited to run git commands on my terminal
because as lame as it may sound, but typing anything
on the command line is still the second-best feeling 
for me, getting a pull request merged, remains the
first. After being familiar with the basic commands and
principles, I started reading blogs related to hacktoberfest
and other open-source programs.
At first, it appeared very difficult, things were not very 
clear and I was quite skeptical if I can pull this off.
I am a decent programmer and I was very uncertain if I would
be able to make even one sensible contribution.
Then I consulted fellow community members and they gave me 
some meaningful insights and busted all the myths.
>Communication, therefore, is the first and foremost important
>thing in this community.
 
Having clarified all my doubts, I registered for hacktoberfest. 
The website was cool and it had all the necessary information
regarding the basic guidelines about the fest. 
There was even a dedicated section that listed beginner-friendly projects.
I quickly went through the list and found some easy projects then and
there only. 
I started working on the projects and finished them as quickly as I could.
Having made four PRs, I was quite contented and satisfied but I never
knew that it's not as easy as it seems.
In the greed of completing the challenge
and claiming my t-shirt, I had made one useless PR and it was 
rejected as it was against the community standards.
I was shattered but I didn't give up this time.
I began searching for some useful yet [beginner-friendly projects](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/).
Finally, I completed the challenge and all of my PRs were accepted.
The feeling was euphoric.
I received a mail on 23rd October to claim my T-shirt and swags.
>This part of my life, this little part is called happiness 

To conclude, I would say that if you are preparing to dive in only
for T-shirts or swags, I don't think this will ever be a wise decision.
Open-source as far as I have got to know is all about learning and
teaching through community interaction.
Even if you fail to complete the necessary challenges,
you will learn a lot and that will remain with you forever.
