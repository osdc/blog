[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is around the corner, and so is  OSDC’s meetup on **Intro to Git and Github**.

It’s a common question of all the newbies out there, how do I start contributing to Open Source, in answer to which  we had our meetup on 14th September 2018, where the overall response was more than great, we discussed about many different things to consider we learned about available tools at our disposal few of which are Git and Github and knowing a great deal about them is an asset for you to be an Open Sourcerer.

##### What do you actually do in and around Hacktoberfest? #####

Well, It’s a month long celebration of Open Source, where you have to create 5 pull requests (for 2018) in any Open Source project of your choice and at the end you get your own free swags in the form of t-shirt and stickers, do you wonder how to be a part of Hacktoberfest’ 18 and Open Source in general?

Then getting yourself familiarized with Git and Github is your answer, for which OSDC will be meeting you again in the coming week, it’s always great to have an idea about what you will working on in your coming days and for which here I propose a **Gentle Introduction to Git and Github**

##### What is Git? #####

It’s one of legendary softwares created by Linus Torvalds, it is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) or a Source Control Management tool used widely by software developers and organisations.

##### Now what the heck does DVCS mean? #####
Version Control System is another term for **“Source Control Management”** (SCM)which is nothing but a process used by software creators to have a historical record of all the changes made to the project file or the codebase, now this also allows workflow management, which is basically gearing up large teams to contribute on the same project which contains thousands of files and may be complex to work on if tools like git are not used. 

If you notice there is a prefix **D** now this stands as Distributed in DVCS, there are two types of VCSs : Centralized and Distributed, the DVCS don’t rely on central server to store all the versions of a project files unlike Cenralized, the programmers local hard drive act as the place for storing the version information of the **Cloned Repository** (local copy of the place where all the project files are stored), the copy on the local machine contains everything available in the remote copy.

##### What is GitHub? #####

Github is the social space where amazing people and organisations hosts their project and collaborate in order to create those amazing Free & Open Source Softwares we care about, it is the largest social network of developers, Github took Git to the next level and since development is not only about coding it is also about communicating, Github plays a large role in that, connecting with like minded people on github is one of the best things which happened with programmers 

Want to dive deep into more of Git & Github ? Wanna know how **Forking, Cloning, Pulling & Pushing, Branching, Rebasing, Merging** and all of this works ? then see you there at our next meetup and after all **Git + Github = OpenSource + Love !**
