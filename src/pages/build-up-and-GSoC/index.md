This post is a little late, but that's mainly because it has been a pretty eventful time period since the last post. The spoilers are already in that title (very sorry for that), but still let's mention the 2 major events that needs to be talked about here:
 - Build-up! 2018(the name we've given to our hackathon)
 - Google Summer of Code 2018

So, talking about the hackathon, let's first get the disappointing bits out first. We were given a, let's say - "not an easy time" trying to organise the entire thing in Cybersrishti. Yet, we tried our best and managed to host the event in a relatively successful manner. I say "relatively" because we were expecting more participation that we actually got. Still, the ones who participated were pretty satisfied with everything, including the external judges. We saw some great projects, and people actually tried to implement some features like - progressive web apps, accessibility, isomorphism etc. And to our great surprise, 3/4 prizes were won by teams from 1st year of our college (including sec 128).

This year, we saw a 6 people getting selected for GSoC from our college (including sec 128), and one person acting as a mentor in one of the organisations. This may not seem like a large number, but it's definitely better from last year. (oh, and did I mention that 3/6 people selected are actually a part of OSDC! 4 if you also include the mentor!)
Well, TBH we're not exactly sure what counts as an official post right now, but this is the first one regardless.
